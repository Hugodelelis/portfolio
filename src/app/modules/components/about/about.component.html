            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>Hello, I'm Hugo, a front-end developer passionate about creating intuitive and engaging digital experiences.
                I believe that design should be as functional as it is beautiful, and I strive to balance aesthetics and usability in every project. I'm always 
                ready to collaborate and share knowledge 
                because I believe that continuous learning is essential in this ever-evolving field. Outside of work, I love exploring new tools and frameworks, as well as 
                participating in developer communities. I'm excited to tackle new challenges and contribute to projects that truly make a difference!
            </p>
