                    Hello, I'm Hugo, a front-end developer passionate about creating intuitive and engaging digital experiences. I believe that
                    design should be as functional as it is beautiful, and I strive to balance aesthetics and usability in every project. I'm always
                    ready to collaborate and share knowledge because I believe that continuous learning is essential in this ever-evolving field. Outside of work,
                    I love exploring new tools and frameworks, as well as participating in developer communities. I'm excited to tackle new
                    challenges and contribute to projects that truly make a difference!
                </p>
